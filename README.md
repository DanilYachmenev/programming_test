# programming_test

This is what I could do so far.

Unfortunately, I could not complete all the tasks in time because of my current lack if financial statistics. 
Although, I hope you might find my python skill sufficient enough and I can catch up all the necessary stats on my free time.

Thanks for reading my code!
